# Practice Templates

This directory contains practice files and templates that are available for download from the resources page.

## Adding Your Templates

1. Place your template files in this directory
2. Update the resources.html module to reference these files
3. Make sure the resource-handler.js is configured to deliver these files

## Recommended Template Types

1. **Starter Templates** - Basic files with structure but minimal content for practice
2. **Project Templates** - More complex files for building full projects
3. **Exercise Files** - Files with specific exercises to complete
4. **Sample Data Sets** - Real-world data for analysis practice

## Naming Convention

Use descriptive names with underscores, for example:
- `basic_starter_template.ext`
- `project_template.ext`
- `practice_exercise.ext`
- `sample_dataset.ext`

Replace .ext with the appropriate file extension for your topic (e.g., .xlsx for Excel files).
