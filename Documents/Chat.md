## Introduction to Copilot Chat

### What is Microsoft Copilot Chat?

Microsoft Copilot Chat represents a significant advancement in AI-powered assistance within the Microsoft 365 ecosystem. It functions as an intelligent conversational interface that helps users accomplish a wide range of tasks, from answering questions to generating content and automating processes. Copilot Chat leverages artificial intelligence to enhance productivity by streamlining workflows, foster creativity through intelligent suggestions, and uplevel user skills within a familiar chat-based environment.

At its core, Microsoft Copilot Chat intelligently combines:
- The capabilities of advanced large language models (LLMs)
- Your personal and organizational data (with appropriate permissions)
- Information from the web (when enabled)

This powerful combination enables Copilot Chat to provide contextually relevant assistance tailored to your specific needs and working environment.

### Accessing Copilot Chat

Microsoft has designed Copilot Chat to be readily accessible across multiple platforms and entry points, ensuring you can access its capabilities wherever you work:

**Web Browser Access:**
- Navigate directly to [Microsoft365.com/copilot](https://microsoft365.com/copilot) or [m365copilot.com](https://m365copilot.com)
- Sign in with your Microsoft 365 credentials

**Integrated Access Within Applications:**

- Accessible in the Teams and Outlook mobile apps

For frequent users, it's recommended to pin Copilot Chat within these applications for quicker access. Your organization's administrator may have already configured this for optimal accessibility.

## Understanding Copilot Chat Modes

One of the most important concepts to understand about Copilot Chat is that it offers two distinct modes of operation, accessible through the "Work" and "Web" tabs within the interface. Each mode serves different purposes and accesses different data sources.

### The "Work" Section

The "Work" section of Copilot Chat is specifically designed to tap into your Microsoft 365 environment and provide assistance grounded in your organizational data.

**Data Sources:**
- Files in your OneDrive and SharePoint sites
- Email communications in Outlook
- Calendar events and meetings
- Teams conversations and meeting transcripts
- Other Microsoft 365 content you have permission to access

**Key Capabilities:**
1. **Personalized Information Retrieval**: Ask questions about your work content, such as "What did Sarah say about the Q4 budget in yesterday's meeting?" or "Find the latest sales figures in my Excel files."

2. **Content Creation and Brainstorming**: Generate drafts, ideas, and content based on your work context, such as "Draft an agenda for tomorrow's project review meeting" or "Suggest topics for our upcoming presentation."

3. **Summarization and Synthesis**: Quickly understand large amounts of information with requests like "Summarize the last 10 emails about the marketing campaign" or "Give me the key points from yesterday's team meeting."

4. **Teams Chat Summaries**: Summarize up to 30 days of Teams chat content with queries like "What has my team discussed about the new product launch?"

5. **Agent Integration**: Access specialized AI agents that can perform specific tasks using your work data, such as scheduling meetings or retrieving customer information.

**Security Note:** All interactions in the "Work" section are protected by enterprise data protection measures. Your organizational data remains within the secure Microsoft 365 environment and is not used to train the underlying AI model.

### The "Web" Section

The "Web" tab in Copilot Chat provides access to information from the public internet and the knowledge embedded within the large language model.

**Data Sources:**
- Public web content indexed by Bing
- General knowledge from the LLM
- **Important:** The "Web" section does not access any of your private Microsoft 365 data

**Key Capabilities:**
1. **General Knowledge Queries**: Ask questions on virtually any topic, such as "What are the latest trends in renewable energy?" or "Explain quantum computing in simple terms."

2. **Research and Analysis**: Conduct market research, gather industry insights, and explore trends with queries like "What are the top challenges facing healthcare organizations in 2025?"

3. **Web Content Summarization**: When using Microsoft Edge, summarize open webpages or PDF documents with prompts like "Summarize this article" or "Give me the key points from this document."

4. **Contextual Suggestions**: In Microsoft Edge, receive prompt suggestions based on the content of your open pages.

5. **Image Generation**: Create AI-generated images based on text descriptions.

**Transparency Features:**
- Web search results include linked citations to sources
- Integration with Bing SafeSearch settings, including the "Strict" option

### Key Differences Between Modes

Understanding when to use each mode is essential for effectively leveraging Copilot Chat:

| Feature | Work | Web |
|---------|------|-----|
| **Primary Data Source** | Microsoft 365 data (files, emails, chats, meetings) | Public web and LLM knowledge |
| **Access to Work Data** | Yes | No |
| **Use Cases** | Internal tasks, summarizing work content, finding work-related information | General research, exploring external topics, brainstorming |
| **Data Protection** | Enterprise data protection (within your organization's Microsoft 365 environment) | Enterprise data protection (for the interface itself, not accessing private work data) |
| **Citations** | May cite specific work documents or communications | Provides linked citations to web sources |

**When to Use Each Mode:**
- Use the **Work** section when you need information from your organization's data or want to create content based on your work context.
- Use the **Web** section for general knowledge questions, research, or when you need information from outside your organization.

## Core Features and Capabilities

   - Example: "Can you make this more technical and include data from our Q1 report?"

2. **Adjust the Format or Structure:**
   - Request a different presentation of the information
   - Example: "Please organize this information in a table instead of paragraphs"

3. **Change the Scope:**
   - Narrow or broaden your request as needed
   - Example: "Focus only on the marketing aspects" or "Expand this to include international markets"

4. **Provide Examples:**
   - Show Copilot what you're looking for
   - Example: "I want something similar to this: [example]"

5. **Use Follow-up Questions:**
