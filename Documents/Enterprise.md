## Effective Prompting Techniques for Enterprise Use

To harness the full potential of Microsoft Copilot, mastering the art of effective prompting is essential. The quality and relevance of Copilot's responses are directly influenced by the clarity and precision of the prompts provided by the user. Therefore, understanding how to craft well-structured prompts is a fundamental skill for enterprise users.

An effective prompt typically incorporates four key elements: Goal, Context, Data Source, and Expectation. The Goal clearly states what the user aims to achieve with the prompt. The Context provides any necessary background information to set the scene for the task. The Data Source mentions any specific data or documents that Copilot should refer to in its response. Finally, the Expectation specifies how the user expects Copilot to respond, including the desired format or level of detail. For example, instead of a vague prompt like "Summarise this document," a more effective prompt would be: "Goal: Summarise this marketing report. Context: The report details the Q3 campaign performance. Data Source: [Link to document]. Expectation: Provide a bulleted list of the top three key findings and the overall ROI."

Users can also explore different styles of phrasing their prompts. They can ask direct questions, issue specific commands, or provide detailed context followed by a request for a particular output. Experimenting with different phrasing can often lead to more nuanced and helpful results. Furthermore, the process of interacting with Copilot is often iterative. If the initial response is not quite what the user intended, they can refine their prompt by adding more detail, adjusting the context, or clarifying their expectations. Copilot's availability of different conversation styles, such as "Balanced" for factual responses and "Creative" for more imaginative content, offers another way to influence the output based on the specific task at hand.

Providing relevant context is crucial for obtaining accurate and useful responses, especially in an enterprise setting where information is often specific and interconnected. Users can significantly improve the quality of Copilot's output by referencing specific documents, emails, or meetings that are relevant to their prompt. For instance, when drafting a project update, a user could prompt Copilot to "Summarise the key decisions from our last project meeting [link to meeting notes] and incorporate the latest progress from this status report [link to report]." Recent updates have made this even more seamless, allowing users to reference content within the same document or from other files stored in the cloud. In Word, users can now reference up to ten different items, including files, emails, and meetings, when drafting a document, enabling more comprehensive and contextually rich content creation.

To further assist users in crafting effective prompts, Microsoft provides valuable resources like the Copilot Prompt Gallery. This gallery serves as a central repository where users can discover, save, and share their favourite and most effective prompts. It offers a wide range of examples that can be readily used or adapted for various scenarios across Microsoft 365 applications, Copilot Chat, and AI agents. By exploring the prompts available in the gallery, users can gain inspiration and understand the types of requests that Copilot is capable of handling. Additionally, the Microsoft Copilot Scenario Library offers further examples and use cases, illustrating how Copilot can be applied to common enterprise tasks. These resources are invaluable for both new and experienced users, helping them to unlock the full potential of Microsoft Copilot by leveraging the collective knowledge of the user community and best practices identified by Microsoft.
