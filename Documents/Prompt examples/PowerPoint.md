## Tips for Using These Prompts
- **Test and Refine**: Copilot’s outputs can vary due to LLM randomness—iterate prompts for better results.
- **Keep Prompts Short**: Long prompts may hit word limits (e.g., ~2000 characters)—split complex requests.
- **Specify Files**: Use “/filename” for file-based prompts; ensure files are in OneDrive and <24 MB.
- **Verify Outputs**: Check for accuracy, especially with examples or data, as Copilot may hallucinate.
- **Leverage Context**: Add audience, tone, or slide numbers for precision.
- **Limitations**: No direct image editing (use Designer separately); internet connection required.

These prompts are designed to be practical and adaptable. Experiment with them in PowerPoint and tweak based on your needs or Copilot’s responses!
