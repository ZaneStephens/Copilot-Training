## Tips for Using These Prompts
- **Access Copilot**: Type “/” in Loop to trigger commands (e.g., /draft, /summarize).
- **Be Specific**: Include details like file names, word counts, or column names for precision.
- **Cloud Only**: Loop requires internet; save files to OneDrive/SharePoint for integration.
- **Iterate**: Refine outputs (e.g., “Make it shorter”) if initial results miss the mark.
- **Limitations**: 50-user edit cap, no offline mode, English prompts work best.
- **Verify**: Check generated content (e.g., code, summaries) for accuracy.
- **Share Components**: Convert content to Loop components for Teams/Outlook sync.

These prompts are tailored to Loop’s collaborative strengths—adapt them to your team’s needs and experiment with Copilot’s evolving capabilities!
