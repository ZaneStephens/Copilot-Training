## Getting Started with Copilot in Outlook

### Accessing and Enabling Copilot

To begin utilizing Microsoft Copilot in Outlook, you'll need:

- An active Microsoft 365 subscription (and depending on your specific plan, a separate Copilot license)
- A compatible version of Outlook:
  - New Outlook for Windows and Mac
  - Outlook on the web
  - Classic Outlook for Windows (Current Channel or Monthly Enterprise Channel)
  - Outlook mobile apps for iOS and Android

You'll need to sign in to your Outlook application or web interface using your Microsoft 365 account credentials to access Copilot features. The Copilot icon, which serves as the entry point to its functionalities, is typically located on the main toolbar within the Outlook interface or within the email composition window.

For users of the New Outlook, the Copilot icon might not appear immediately after installation; a restart of the application and a synchronization of Microsoft 365 settings may be required. Similarly, for those accessing Outlook through a web browser, refreshing the page might be necessary to display the Copilot icon.

**Note on account compatibility**: Copilot works with:
- Work or school accounts provided by organizations
- Personal Microsoft accounts (outlook.com, hotmail.com, live.com, msn.com)
- It does NOT work with third-party email accounts connected to Outlook (Gmail, Yahoo, iCloud)

### Understanding the Copilot Interface

The Copilot interface is designed to be intuitive and integrated within the familiar Outlook environment, though slight variations exist across different versions:

- **Accessing features**: Clicking the Copilot icon (often found in the toolbar or ribbon at the top of the Outlook window) will reveal options like "Draft with Copilot" for composing new emails and "Coaching by Copilot" for refining existing drafts.
- **Summarization tools**: For email threads, a dedicated button labeled "Summary by Copilot" or simply "Summarize" is commonly located at the top of the email thread when a message is selected.
- **Chat functionality**: The Copilot chat feature typically opens as a side pane in the New Outlook for Windows and Outlook on the web, providing a space for interactive assistance. In classic Outlook, the Copilot chat might open as a full-size window.
- **Prompt box**: This central element allows you to input requests in natural language or select from suggested prompts, guiding Copilot on the desired action.
- **Adjustment options**: Many Copilot functionalities include options to adjust the tone and length of generated content through dropdown menus or dedicated "Generate options."
