Copilot in the Microsoft 365 admin center respects role-based access controls (RBAC) and only surfaces information and controls that the particular admin has access to. Critically, it does not make any configuration changes on behalf of an admin without explicit instruction, ensuring the integrity and security of sensitive administrative functions.
