### Crafting Effective Prompts

The quality of Copilot's output depends significantly on the quality of your prompts. Here are tips for crafting effective prompts:

**Specify format and tone**:
- Request a particular format: "Create a bulleted list of key points for the customer meeting"
- Indicate desired tone: "Draft a formal response to the customer complaint" or "Write a friendly check-in email"

**Use iterative refinement**:
- Start with a basic prompt and then refine the output: "Make this email more concise" or "Add more details about our premium support option"
- Ask Copilot to adjust specific aspects: "Rewrite the second paragraph to emphasize the cost savings"

### Leveraging AI-Generated Content

While Copilot provides powerful assistance, it's important to use its outputs effectively:

**Always review and edit**:
