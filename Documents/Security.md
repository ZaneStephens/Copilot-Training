```

Copilot will process the alert data and provide a concise overview that includes:
- Attack type and techniques used
- Timeline of events
- Affected systems and users
- Initial assessment of potential impact
- Related IOCs (Indicators of Compromise)

**Expanding Investigation:**

To dive deeper into specific aspects of an incident:
```
"Show me all activities performed by user jsmith@company.com in the 24 hours before this alert."
```

```
"What other alerts or events are related to the IP address 203.0.113.100?"
```

**Impact Assessment:**

To understand the scope and potential damage:
```
"What sensitive data could have been accessed during this incident?"
```

```
"Show me the potential attack path from the compromised endpoint to our critical assets."
```

**Remediation Planning:**

For guidance on containing and resolving the incident:
```
"Provide step-by-step instructions to isolate the affected endpoint and remove the malware."
```

```
"What actions should we take to prevent similar phishing attacks in the future?"
```

**Real-World Example:**

When investigating a user account reporting login problems, an analyst could prompt:
```
"Check recent login activity for user ajones@company.com including failed attempts."
```

Copilot might reveal numerous failed login attempts from various locations, indicating a potential brute force attack, and recommend immediate password resets and enabling MFA.

### Generating KQL Queries for Threat Hunting

Effective threat hunting requires the ability to craft precise KQL queries, a skill that Copilot simplifies through natural language processing:

**Basic Query Generation:**

To start a threat hunting session:
```
"Create a KQL query to find all PowerShell executions with encoded commands in the past week."
```

Copilot will generate a properly formatted KQL query such as:
```
DeviceProcessEvents
| where Timestamp > ago(7d)
| where FileName =~ "powershell.exe"
| where ProcessCommandLine contains "-enc" or ProcessCommandLine contains "-encodedCommand"
| project Timestamp, DeviceName, AccountName, ProcessCommandLine
```

**Complex Scenario Queries:**

For more sophisticated hunting:
```
"Find devices that communicated with newly registered domains (less than 30 days old) and also had antivirus alerts in the last 48 hours."
```

**Iterative Refinement:**

After reviewing initial results:
```
"Modify the previous query to exclude IT department devices and only include executive workstations."
```

**Combining with External Context:**

```
"Update the query to check if any of the external IPs are listed in threat intelligence feeds."
```

**Tips for Effective KQL Generation:**

1. Start with clear, specific intentions
2. Include relevant time frames
3. Specify the data sources you want to query
4. Mention desired output format (e.g., "display as a table with columns for timestamp, user, and IP address")
5. Iteratively refine based on initial results

### Analyzing Script Content

Malicious scripts are common components in security incidents, and Copilot excels at helping analysts understand their purpose and impact:

**Basic Script Analysis:**

When encountering a suspicious script:
```
"Explain what this PowerShell script does and identify any potentially malicious actions."
```

Copilot will analyze the script and provide:
- Functions and purpose
- Suspicious techniques (obfuscation, encoding, etc.)
- Potential impact if executed
- Known malware families with similar characteristics

**Detailed Malware Analysis:**

For deeper understanding:
```
"Show me the C2 (command and control) communication methods in this script."
```

```
"What persistence mechanisms does this script attempt to establish?"
```

**Defensive Recommendations:**

To enhance protection:
```
"What detection rules should we implement to catch similar scripts in the future?"
```

```
"How can we modify our security controls to prevent this script from executing?"
```

**Example Workflow:**

1. Microsoft Defender flags a script execution as potentially malicious
2. Analyst extracts the script and asks Copilot for analysis
3. Copilot identifies it as a credential harvester that attempts to exfiltrate data
4. Based on Copilot's analysis, the analyst creates a response plan
5. The analyst asks Copilot to suggest detection rules for similar future attempts

**Expected Outcome:** Development of an effective threat hunting query, identification of potential security issues, and creation of a reusable hunting methodology.

### Exercise 3: Script Analysis

**Objective:** Practice using Copilot to analyze potentially malicious scripts and understand their functionality.

**Prerequisites:**
- Access to the Security Copilot portal
- A sample suspicious script (from a sandbox environment, detonation chamber, or publicly available malware sample)

**Steps:**

1. **Prepare the Script:**
   - Identify a suspicious script that was flagged in your environment or use a de-fanged sample
   - Ensure the script is in a secure, isolated environment

2. **Basic Analysis:**
   - In the Security Copilot portal, prompt: "Analyze this PowerShell script and explain what it does"
   - Follow up with: "Identify any obfuscation techniques used in this script"

3. **Identify Malicious Behaviors:**
   - Ask Copilot: "What potentially malicious actions does this script attempt to perform?"
   - Request specific information: "Does this script attempt to establish persistence? If so, how?"
   - Inquire about data theft: "Does this script attempt to access or exfiltrate sensitive information?"

4. **Compare with Known Threats:**
   - Prompt: "Does this script match patterns associated with known malware families or threat actors?"
   - Ask: "What MITRE ATT&CK techniques are exhibited in this script?"

5. **Develop Defensive Measures:**
   - Request: "What detection rules would identify this script or similar variants?"
   - Ask: "What preventive measures would block the execution or impact of this script?"
   - Prompt: "Generate YARA rules that would detect this script or similar variants"

6. **Document Findings:**
   - Ask Copilot to create a comprehensive report: "Create a malware analysis report for this script including IOCs, behaviors, and recommended defenses"

**Expected Outcome:** Thorough understanding of a suspicious script's functionality, identification of malicious behaviors, and development of appropriate defensive measures.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Does Copilot for Security require Microsoft Sentinel to function?**

A: While Copilot for Security can work without Microsoft Sentinel, its capabilities are significantly enhanced with Sentinel integration. Functions like advanced threat hunting with KQL query generation are particularly dependent on Sentinel's extensive log data. Organizations will get the most value from Copilot when using it with Sentinel, but many features like incident investigation in Defender XDR, script analysis, and certain aspects of security posture management can still be used without Sentinel.

**Q: Who is the intended user of Microsoft Copilot for Security?**

A: Microsoft Copilot for Security is designed for several roles within security and IT teams:
- Security analysts (primary users) for investigating incidents, threat hunting, and response
- IT administrators for security posture management and device security
- Security leaders (CISOs and managers) for risk assessment and strategic planning
- Threat intelligence analysts for research and threat tracking

Each role can leverage different aspects of Copilot's capabilities according to their specific responsibilities.

**Q: How is Copilot for Security licensed and priced?**

A: Copilot for Security pricing is based on security compute units (SCUs). There are no additional licensing requirements for using Copilot within integrated services like Microsoft Intune. For the most current pricing information, contact your Microsoft representative or partner, as licensing models may evolve over time.

**Q: Can Copilot generate false or inaccurate information?**

A: Like all AI systems, Copilot can occasionally generate information that is incomplete or inaccurate. This is why human validation remains essential. Always verify critical information using additional sources, and apply professional judgment before taking actions based on Copilot's recommendations. Microsoft continues to improve the accuracy of Copilot through regular updates and user feedback.

**Q: Is my organization's data used to train Copilot?**

A: Microsoft has implemented robust privacy and data security measures for Copilot for Security. Your organizational data remains protected and is not used to train the foundation AI models. Copilot's use of data aligns with existing Microsoft 365 commitments regarding data protection and privacy.

**Q: Does Copilot support languages other than English?**

A: Yes, Copilot supports multiple languages for both the user interface and the underlying AI models. However, the breadth of language support and the quality of non-English responses may vary. Check the latest Microsoft documentation for specific language support details.

**Q: How does Copilot handle sensitive security information?**

A: Copilot adheres to your existing security permissions and access controls. It can only access data that you have permission to view, and it operates within your organization's security boundaries. Copilot's processing of information follows Microsoft's enterprise-grade security and compliance standards, including data residency requirements where applicable.

**Q: Can Copilot take automated actions in my environment?**

A: While Copilot can suggest remediation actions, it typically does not automatically implement changes without explicit approval. Copilot operates with the principle of "human in the loop," meaning it provides recommendations that security professionals can then choose to implement. This ensures that critical security decisions remain under human control.
