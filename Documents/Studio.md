## Building and Managing Agent Conversations (Topics)

### Understanding Topics

Topics form the fundamental structure of an agent's conversational abilities. They define what an agent knows and how it responds to user inquiries. Each topic represents a distinct conversational pathway, and when combined, they create a seamless, natural dialogue experience.

Think of topics as the individual skills or competencies of your agent. For example, an HR assistant agent might have separate topics for handling vacation requests, answering benefits questions, and providing new hire information.

Understanding how topics work is essential for designing effective conversation flows that meet user needs while maintaining a natural dialogue experience.

### Creating New Topics

Microsoft Copilot Studio offers multiple approaches to creating new topics:

1. **From Scratch**: Navigate to the Topics section, select "New topic," and then choose "From blank" to start with an empty canvas.

2. **Using Generative AI**: Describe the topic you envision, and let the AI assist in building it for you. This innovative approach leverages natural language descriptions to rapidly create topic structures.

3. **Starter Prompts**: The platform can automatically generate initial conversation starters for new agents based on the overall description and instructions provided during agent creation.

The integration of AI in topic creation significantly accelerates the development process, allowing you to quickly establish the basic framework for your agent's conversations without extensive manual configuration.

### Defining Trigger Phrases

Trigger phrases are the specific words and phrases that users might input to initiate a particular topic within your agent. They play a crucial role in training the agent's natural language understanding (NLU) model to recognize user intent.

Best practices for creating effective trigger phrases include:

- Include at least 5-10 trigger phrases initially for each topic
- Vary sentence structure and key terms to improve recognition
- Keep trigger phrases relatively short (under 10 words) for better accuracy
- Avoid single-word trigger phrases, which can cause confusion between similar topics
- Use complete phrases that reflect how real users might ask questions
- Maintain a balanced distribution of trigger phrases across all topics
- When possible, use actual data from user interactions with deployed agents

Well-designed trigger phrases are critical for the agent's ability to correctly interpret user intent and activate the most relevant conversation flow.

### Building Conversation Flows

The interactive flow of a conversation within a topic is constructed using a visual authoring canvas populated with various types of nodes:

- **Message Nodes**: Display textual responses from the agent to the user, providing information or guidance
- **Question Nodes**: Prompt the user for specific information, storing their input in designated variables for later use
- **Action Nodes**: Enable the agent to perform tasks, such as invoking a Power Automate flow or connecting to an external service
- **Condition Nodes**: Introduce branching logic into the conversation, allowing the agent to follow different paths based on criteria or user responses

This node-based visual editor offers a simplified approach to designing even complex conversation flows, making it accessible to users without extensive technical expertise by eliminating the need for coding.

### Topic Branching and Redirects

Topic branching and redirects provide flexibility and modularity in conversation design:

- **Branching**: Based on conditions evaluated within condition nodes, conversations can dynamically branch to address different user scenarios or requirements
- **Redirects**: Topics can be configured to redirect to other topics, creating reusable conversational components that can be invoked from multiple points

This capability is particularly useful for handling complex logic or guiding users to relevant information in specialized topics. By utilizing branching and redirects effectively, you can build well-structured and easily maintainable agents where conversational logic is organized into reusable modules.

## Enhancing Understanding with Entities and Slot Filling

### Understanding Entities

Entities are fundamental to enhancing an agent's intelligence. They enable the agent to recognize and extract specific types of information from user input, going beyond simple keyword recognition to understand the meaning and context behind the words and phrases users employ.

By identifying and extracting key pieces of information, entities significantly improve the agent's ability to acquire and utilize data more effectively during conversations. For example, an entity might help the agent recognize dates, product names, or account numbers within a user's message.

### Types of Entities

Microsoft Copilot Studio provides several types of entities to help your agent understand and extract information:

1. **Prebuilt Entities**: Automatically recognize common information types such as:
   - Dates and times
   - Numbers and monetary values
   - Personal names
   - Locations
   - Email addresses
   - Phone numbers

2. **Custom Entities**: Created to define and recognize information specific to your agent's domain:
   - **Closed List Entities**: Contain a finite list of specific items and their synonyms
   - **Regular Expression (Regex) Entities**: Use patterns to match specific formats of information

The availability of both prebuilt and custom entities offers a flexible approach to tailoring the agent's understanding to meet the specific needs of its intended purpose.

### Slot Filling Mechanism

Slot filling is a natural language understanding technique where the agent extracts entity values from user input and automatically populates corresponding variables. When entities are integrated into question nodes within a topic, Copilot Studio can intelligently detect and extract the necessary information directly from the user's initial query.

Key aspects of slot filling include:

- **Proactive Extraction**: The agent can detect and extract information from the initial user query
- **Efficient Conversations**: Often allows the agent to bypass redundant questions, leading to more streamlined interactions
- **Intelligent Follow-up**: If the initial user input lacks all required information, the agent will only prompt for missing pieces
- **Configurable Control**: The platform offers control over proactive slot filling at the individual node level

This intelligent gathering of information significantly enhances the user experience by reducing the number of prompts and allowing the agent to quickly obtain the necessary details to fulfill requests.

### Entity Best Practices

To maximize the effectiveness of entities, consider these best practices:

- **Add Synonyms**: For closed list entities, include synonyms for each item to expand recognition capabilities
- **Enable Smart Matching**: Use fuzzy logic to interpret user input even with minor misspellings or variations
- **Leverage Regular Expressions**: For complex information patterns, use regex entities for precise extraction
- **Connect to External Data**: For large or frequently changing datasets, connect to external data sources rather than maintaining extensive closed lists
- **Optimize Topic Structure**: Use entities to reduce the overall number of topics by storing variations in user input as variables

Adhering to these best practices ensures that entities are defined in a way that optimizes the agent's understanding and improves the overall conversational flow.

## Connecting to Data and Extending Functionality

### Knowledge Sources Integration

A key aspect of building intelligent agents is the ability to connect to various knowledge sources. These sources enable the agent to access and utilize data to provide relevant information and insightful responses.
