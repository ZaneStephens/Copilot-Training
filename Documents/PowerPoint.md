# Microsoft Copilot in PowerPoint: Comprehensive User Guide

## Introduction

Microsoft Copilot represents a significant advancement in PowerPoint, offering users an AI-powered assistant directly integrated into the application. This guide provides a comprehensive overview of Copilot's features and functionalities, enabling you to effectively leverage this tool to create, enhance, and deliver impactful presentations.

Copilot's integration within PowerPoint leverages large language models to assist with various aspects of presentation creation. This includes the ability to generate initial drafts, suggest design improvements, summarize existing presentations, and even help with practicing delivery. The benefits of using Copilot extend beyond simple automation:

- It helps ensure consistency in style and branding
- Offers design options that might not have been immediately apparent
- Provides a platform for iterative development of presentation content
- Makes professional-quality presentation creation more accessible and efficient for users of all skill levels

## Getting Started with Copilot

### Accessing Copilot in PowerPoint

The Copilot button is typically located in the Home tab of the PowerPoint ribbon, usually on the far right side. Clicking this button will open the Copilot pane as a sidebar on the right side of the screen. This pane is the primary interface for interacting with Copilot. It often displays initial prompt suggestions to guide new users and provides an input area where you can type your own requests or questions.

### Prerequisites for Using Copilot

To use Copilot effectively in PowerPoint, ensure you have:

- Microsoft 365 Apps installed on your machine
- An active internet connection (Copilot relies on cloud-based AI processing)
- A Microsoft OneDrive account for saving and accessing files

### Setting Up for Optimal Performance

For Copilot to function optimally, especially when utilizing features like creating presentations from existing files, it is often necessary to save the PowerPoint presentation to OneDrive. In some cases, the Copilot button might appear greyed out if the presentation has not been saved to OneDrive.

To save your presentation to OneDrive:
1. Navigate to File > Save As > OneDrive within PowerPoint
2. Save your presentation with an appropriate name
3. Consider enabling the Autosave feature for continuous saving to OneDrive

When using the "Create presentation from file" feature, the source file itself, whether it's a Word document or a PDF, must also be saved in OneDrive for Copilot to access and process its content.

## Creating Presentations with Copilot

Copilot offers two primary methods for generating presentations: creating from scratch using prompts and creating from existing files.

### Creating Presentations from Scratch

To create a presentation from scratch:

1. Open a blank presentation within PowerPoint
2. Select the Copilot button in the Home tab of the ribbon
3. In the Copilot pane, find the option to "Create a presentation" (or type this into the prompt area)
4. Provide a detailed prompt describing the presentation you want Copilot to generate
5. Click the Send button (often depicted as a paper airplane icon)
6. Copilot will process your prompt and generate a multi-slide presentation containing AI-generated content based on your description

#### Crafting Effective Prompts

The quality of your prompt significantly influences the quality of the generated presentation. Consider including:

- The specific topic of the presentation
- The intended goal or outcome (e.g., to inform, to persuade)
- The target audience (influences tone and detail level)
- Essential information or specific points to include
- Preferred tone or style (e.g., professional, creative, minimalist)
- Desired length or number of slides
- Any specific role Copilot should assume (e.g., "Act as a marketing expert...")

If the initial presentation doesn't meet your expectations, you can refine your original prompt and ask Copilot to regenerate the presentation.

### Creating Presentations from Existing Files

To create a presentation based on existing content:

1. Create a new, blank presentation in PowerPoint
2. Select the Copilot button in the Home tab
3. In the Copilot pane, choose or type "Create presentation from file"
4. When the file picker dialog appears, browse your OneDrive and select the desired document
   - Word documents (.docx) are supported for all Copilot subscribers
   - PDF files may also be supported depending on your license
5. After selecting the file, click Send
6. Copilot will analyze the content and automatically generate a PowerPoint presentation, including slides, layouts, speaker notes, and a design theme

#### Best Practices for Source Documents

To maximize effectiveness when creating presentations from files:

- Leverage Word Styles (e.g., Heading 1, Heading 2, Normal) within the Word document to help Copilot understand the document structure
- Organize content under clear titles and headers using these styles to provide a semantic roadmap for the AI
- Include relevant images in your Word document, as these will likely be incorporated into the generated presentation
- If your organization uses a standard PowerPoint template, open a new presentation using that template before using Copilot
- Keep source Word documents under 24 MB in size for optimal performance

## Reviewing and Editing Presentations

Once Copilot has generated an initial draft, you have various options for refining the content.

### Adding and Removing Slides

You can easily add or remove slides after Copilot has created the initial draft. To add a slide on a specific topic, provide a prompt to Copilot such as "Add a slide outlining the next steps for this project." This flexibility allows you to refine the structure and content of your AI-generated presentations.

### Modifying Text and Images

All content generated by Copilot, including text on slides, is fully editable. You can review and modify this text to ensure its accuracy, clarity, and alignment with your intended message.

To modify images that Copilot has added:
1. Right-click on the image
2. Select the "Change picture" option
3. Choose a replacement image from various sources (local files, OneDrive, online image libraries)

You can also use prompts to instruct Copilot to change, add, or remove specific visuals within the presentation.

### Refining Text with Rewrite Features

Copilot offers a helpful "Rewrite" feature to assist in improving and adapting text on slides:

- **Auto-rewrite**: Enhances clarity and corrects errors with a neutral tone
- **Condense**: Reduces text length while maintaining the original tone
- **Make professional**: Adjusts the tone to be more formal while retaining the original length

Note that the Rewrite feature currently works only on textboxes and operates on the entire content of the textbox at once. You can also provide specific prompts to Copilot to rewrite text in a particular way, such as making it more engaging or adjusting the formality.

### Organizing and Restructuring

Copilot can assist with organizing and restructuring slides. By prompting Copilot to "organize this presentation," the AI will attempt to arrange the slides into logical sections with appropriate headings.

When creating a new presentation, you can review and modify the topics suggested by Copilot before the slides are generated, including adding, removing, and reordering topics.

## Summarizing Presentations

Copilot has a powerful capability to summarize PowerPoint presentations, providing a concise overview of key information.

### Using the Summarization Feature

To summarize a presentation:
1. Open the Copilot pane
2. Type the prompt "Summarize this presentation" into the prompt field
3. Click Send

Copilot will generate a bulleted summary of the presentation's main points, often including references to the specific slides from which the information was extracted. These reference numbers indicate the corresponding slide number in the presentation deck.

The generated summary can be easily copied to the clipboard and pasted into other applications for sharing or further use. Currently, Copilot in PowerPoint can summarize presentations containing up to approximately 40,000 words (around 150 slides).

You can also ask for more specific summaries by using prompts like:
- "Show key slides"
- "Show action items"

### Understanding Reference Numbers

When Copilot generates a summary, it often includes reference numbers alongside each summarized point. These numbers correspond directly to the slide number within the presentation where the summarized information can be found. This direct link allows you to quickly locate the original context of any point within the summary that you wish to explore in more detail.

### Proactive Summary Feature

PowerPoint now offers a Proactive Summary feature. When enabled, Copilot will automatically generate a concise summary of the presentation's key points, and this summary is continuously updated as you navigate through different slides. This dynamic summary is typically displayed in a summary pane located at the top right of the PowerPoint window.

## Integration with Microsoft Designer

Microsoft Copilot seamlessly integrates with Microsoft Designer, an AI-powered tool specifically designed to enhance the visual aspects of presentations.

### Using Designer with Copilot-Generated Content

After a presentation has been generated by Copilot, you can leverage Microsoft Designer to:
- Redesign individual slides
- Apply a consistent visual style across the entire presentation
- Choose from a range of professionally designed layout suggestions
- Maintain visual consistency throughout your presentation

Designer automatically analyzes the content of each slide, including text, images, charts, and tables, and offers layout suggestions tailored to that content.

### Accessing Design Suggestions

To explore the design suggestions offered by Microsoft Designer:

1. Select a content element on a slide (such as an image or a text box)
2. Navigate to the Design tab in the PowerPoint ribbon
3. Click the Designer button (formerly known as "Design Ideas")
4. Browse through the suggestions in the Designer pane
5. Select your preferred design to apply it to the current slide

The Designer pane will often provide an option to apply a chosen design or theme to all slides in the presentation, ensuring a consistent visual style throughout.

### Working with Branded Templates

Organizations that utilize branded PowerPoint templates can effectively use these with Copilot to ensure that AI-generated presentations adhere to company visual identity and branding standards.

The recommended approach:
1. Start by opening a new presentation using the organization's template
2. Use Copilot to generate content from a prompt or from an existing file
3. Copilot will recognize the existing theme and design and will utilize the layouts available in the template

For best results with branded templates:
- Ensure templates are saved in the correct file format (.potx or .pptx)
- Create a varied set of slide layouts within the "Slide Master" view of the template
- You can designate any PowerPoint presentation or template containing your corporate branding as a template for Copilot to use
