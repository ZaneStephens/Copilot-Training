## Understanding Core Concepts

Creating effective copilot agents requires understanding several fundamental concepts that underpin their functionality and behavior.

### Topics and Trigger Phrases

Topics are discrete segments of a conversation between a user and the agent, serving as the essential building blocks of the overall interaction.

**Key aspects of topics:**
- Can be created manually or generated automatically using generative AI
- Composed of trigger phrases and a defined conversation path
- Organized to handle specific types of user inquiries or tasks

**Trigger phrases** are specific words or sentences that, when matched with user input, activate the corresponding topic. Defining multiple trigger phrases for a single topic is crucial, as it allows the agent to recognize the user's intent even when expressed in different ways.

**Best practices for trigger phrases:**
- Include at least 5-10 variations for each topic
- Use complete phrases that reflect how real users might ask questions
- Avoid single-word trigger phrases, which can cause confusion
- Use actual data from user interactions when available

### Actions and Integration

Actions enable agents to respond to users in an automated fashion or can be invoked explicitly from within a topic. They serve as a mechanism to integrate the agent with external systems and services.

**Core action types:**

| Action Type | Description | Example Use Cases |
|-------------|-------------|-------------------|
| Prebuilt connector action | Utilizes pre-existing connectors for popular services | Retrieving weather information, sending emails via Outlook |
| Custom connector action | Connects to external systems through custom-built connectors | Accessing data from a proprietary database |
| Power Automate cloud flow | Invokes automated workflows | Automating approval processes, updating records in Dynamics 365 |
| AI Builder prompts | Leverages AI models to generate text content | Summarizing documents, extracting key information |
| Bot Framework skill | Integrates with existing chatbots | Reusing pre-built conversational components |
| REST API connection | Enables direct communication with web services | Integrating with third-party services |

This diverse range of action types provides extensive integration possibilities, allowing users to tailor their agents to a multitude of unique use cases.

### Knowledge Sources

Knowledge sources equip the agent with the necessary information to answer user queries effectively. When a user poses a question that doesn't directly trigger a specific topic, the agent can intelligently search these knowledge sources to find an appropriate answer.

**Common knowledge sources include:**
- Public websites
- SharePoint sites containing organizational documents
- Microsoft Graph connectors that access Microsoft 365 data
- Other relevant data assets

Establishing connections to relevant and up-to-date knowledge sources is fundamental in building a copilot agent that can provide accurate and contextually appropriate responses.

### Entities and Slot Filling

Entities represent specific pieces of information that the agent can recognize and extract from user input, such as dates, times, locations, names, or product categories.

**Types of entities:**
1. **Prebuilt Entities**: Automatically recognize common information types like dates, times, numbers, names, locations, email addresses, and phone numbers
2. **Custom Entities**:
   - **Closed List Entities**: Contain a finite list of specific items and their synonyms
   - **Regular Expression (Regex) Entities**: Use patterns to match specific formats of information

**Slot filling** is a natural language understanding technique where the agent extracts entity values from user input and automatically populates corresponding variables. This capability significantly enhances the agent's natural language understanding, leading to more intelligent and contextually relevant exchanges.

### Variables

Variables serve as containers for storing customer responses and allowing this information to be reused at different points within the conversation.

**Key aspects of variables:**
- Created automatically when a question node is added to a topic
- Can be created manually using set variable value nodes
- Used in logical expressions to control conversation flow
- Can be passed between different topics or to/from Power Automate flows

Variables enable dynamic and personalized conversational flows, making the agent more responsive to user needs.
